## Parallelism
- Architectures upgrade:
	- changes on agencement componants -> max perf
	- cache memory -> close to cpu -> min bottleneck
	- vectorial processes -> vector registers (cf visual on polycop)
	- Pipeline exec
		- Para: multiple PE and at all level
- How can we do better? **Memory Wall**! -> data access is the limiting element for perf and power consumption.
	- we should to calculation direclty in memory
		- e.g: Cel Automatons
---
- III. **Algorithms**:
	- Linear Equations Systems Solutions
		- Gauss Elimination
		- Gauss-Seidle
		- SDR
		- ...
		- Adaptive, multigrid
	- Other Exemples: Cryptogtaphy
		- fact big numbers -> RSA
			- 1970 bruteforce -> 15x10^9
			- 1990 in 8 years 600 stations paral new algo sofisticated -> success
