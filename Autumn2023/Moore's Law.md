**Moore's law** is the observation that the [number of transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count "Transistor count") in an [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit") doubles about every two years at a pretty constant cost. Moore's law is an [observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation "Observation") and [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting) of a historical trend. Rather than a [law of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_physics "Law of physics"), it is an [empirical relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_relationship "Empirical relationship") linked to [gains from experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright%27s_Law "Wright's Law") in production.
