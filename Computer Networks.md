Before the apparition of personal computers, people used to connect to a **supercomputer** (central computer) and use it.
They would then form what we call a [[Network]].

But what is the use of a [[Network]]?
It as a lot of uses!
- Sharing Resources
- More Reliability in systems
- Less Costs
- More Performances (scalability)
- Communication Media

This sounds great but how would all those computers communicate in practice?
People though about it and came up with an idea: for the [[Host]] to be able to communicate with others, they need to agree on a set of rules. We call those rules [[Protocols]].

We will first study the protocols that use the **physical layer** and **link layer** of the [[OSI Model]] (Open Systems Interconnexion).
Those are the [[ARQ Protocols]]. 

We will consider the 3 common [[ARQ Protocols]] :
- [[Stop-and-Wait ARQ]]
- [[Go-Back-N ARQ]]
- [[Selective-Repeat ARQ]]

To compare those protocols, we will develop simple model and evaluate their [[Performance#Performance in Computer Networks|performance]].
