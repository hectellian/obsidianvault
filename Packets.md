In networking and telecommunications, a packet refers to a **formatted unit of data that can be transmitted over a network**. Each packet contains not only the actual data but also metadata, such as destination and source addresses, that help routers and switches forward it to the appropriate location. Packets are the fundamental units of data exchange in packet-switched networks.

**Packets structure** is defined as:
- **HEADER** : This contains control information such as the source and destination addresses, sequencing information, and other operational parameters.
- **PAYLOAD** (DATA) : This is the actual data being transferred. It is encapsulated in the packet for transmission.
- **TRAILER** : contains additional control or error-checking information.
