Performance is a metric measured in **flop/s** (floating point operations per second)

The current most powerful computer (2023) can go to 
- Exaflops: $10^{18} flops/s$ $\rightarrow$ 8.7M cores
- This machine needs a power of about 20MW to run

When doing huge calculations for big simulations we need huge performances. The machines that can do those calculations are called **HPC** : High Performance Calculation
